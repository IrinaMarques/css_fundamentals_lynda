1.1 What is CSS?
================

Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language developed to control the presentation of markup language documents. 

- Style sheets are a collection of formatting rules

- Styles are most  commonly contained in external files

- Styles are applied to pages in the order they are found, cascading down from external to local styles

==========================
1.2 Default browser styles
==========================

Overwriting default styles 

Benefits of User Control:
- Giving the user control enhances accessibility
- It prevents rendering issues from restricting access to content.
- Users with disabilities ca override smaller text sizes
- On the web, being able to access content matters

1.3 CSS syntax
===============

Selectors - Tells the browser which element or elements in the document to style.
--> img/selectors.png

Declarations - Enclosed on curly braces, uses the formatting instructions for the style. 
--> img/declarations.png

Property and Value - These are separated by colons and use a semicolon to tell the browser to stop evaluating and move on to the next rule.

1.4 Basic selector types
=========================

Element Selector: 
Are global in nature, meaning, they're going to affect every element of that type in a styled document.
--> img/element_selector.png

Class Selector:
Attribute selector is based on class attributes applied to HTML elements. 
--> img/class_selector.png

ID Selector:
Attribute selector is based on ID attributes applied to HTML elements. ID must be unique to the page.
--> img/id_selector.png

Element-specific Selectors:
Modified class or ID selector that limits application to a specific element.
--> img/element_specific_selector.png

Descendent Selector:
Highly specific selectors that target elements based on their location within other elements.
--> img/descendent_selector.png
--> img/descendent_selector_ex1.png
--> img/descendent_selector_ex2.png

Class and ID Naming Conventions:
- No witespace or special characters
- Case sensitive
- Establish standards for your CSS and be consistent with them

Grouping selectors:
Allows you to group selectors that share formatting
--> img/grouping_selectors_ex1.png
--> img/grouping_selectors_ex2.png

======================================
1.5 How CSS works with HTML structure
======================================

Don't use classes and ID attributes arbitrarily.
Classes and IDs should be descriptive and meaningful.
Use consistent HTML structure.

Guidelines for writing HTML:
- Focus on writing clean, efficient code
- Structure the HTML so it add meaning to the content 
- Don't focus on styling when initially structuring the code
- Much easier to style well-structured code

==========================
1.6 CSS authoring options
==========================

Style Location:
- External styles - main.css
- Embedded styles - index.html
- Inline styles - index.html

Authoring Considerations:
- Most projects will rely heavily on external styles.
- Embedded styles are mainly used to overwrite external styles.
- You should plan an overall site strategy for style placement.

==============================
1.7 How browsers apply styles
==============================

How browsers read selectors - from right to left.

The Cascade - external styles are applied first, followed by embedded styles, and finally followed by inline styles, if they're applied within the document. The last rule applied wins.

Inheritance - Inheritance essentially says that child elements will inherit the properties applied to a parent.

Specificity - The more specific rule wins

Styles are Comulative
